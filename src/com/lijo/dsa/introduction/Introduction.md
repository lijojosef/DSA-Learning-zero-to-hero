##Algorithm
Outline, the essence of a computational procedure, step-by-step instructions.

##Program
An implementation of an algorithm in some programming language.

##Data Structure
Organization of data needed to solve problem.

##What is a good algorithm?
 - Efficient: Running time & Space used
 - Efficiency as a function of input size
 
 
 ##Pseudo code
 In computer science, pseudocode is a plain language description of the steps in an algorithm or another system. Pseudocode often uses structural conventions of a normal programming language, but is intended for human reading rather than machine reading -(Wikipedia)
